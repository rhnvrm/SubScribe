00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
this is who I am making fun and make a
joke on Twitter the day of the tragedy

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,880
of people who see something horrible
happened the world they're under the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,880
internet under their social media
Facebook to Twitter whatever they got

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:26,590
and they all right down the exact same
thing my thoughts and prayers

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,530
my thoughts and prayers with the people
in Aurora my thoughts and prayers are

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:44,300
with the families and Boston you know
what that's worth noting

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:53,379
your money or even your compassion all
you are doing all you are doing is

8
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:57,399
saying don't forget about me today

9
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:12,710
distractions in the news right now but
don't forget how sad I am
